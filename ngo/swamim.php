  Swami Mridananda
  </h1>
<p>  
The guidance of Swami Mridananda is instrumental in establishment of the Kendram. After the

Samadhi of Swamiji, the Kendram instituted an award in his name for spiritual seva leaders in the

state. Till now 10 stalwarts received it. In 2016 the Kendram celebrated his birth centenary and

organized year long programs in the state. Further the first Hindu Mahasammelanam at

Aarattupuzha, the deva sangama bhumi, was organized and it was well receicved by the people and

it inspired us to organize the Hindu Mahasammelanam in every year.</p>
