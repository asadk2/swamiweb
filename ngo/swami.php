  <h1>
  Swami Vivekananda
  </h1>
<p>  

 The Kendram is inspired by the rousing call of Swami Vivekananda to serve every man

as God himself-- -‘Nara’ as’ Narayana’.We are driven by his vision of India rising from

the villages and forests, from the most remote and most backward sections of our great

motherland. We therefore strive, in every step, to serve each person as God, to remove

agony, reduce suffering and provide comfort. Liberating people from the clutches of ill

health and poverty and leading them to better lives through education, empowerment

and social regeneration has been the mission of the Kendram all these years.</p>
